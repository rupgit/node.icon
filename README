node.icon 0.3 (Alpha)

author: rupgit

node.icon is a set of scripts that aim at creating different icon libraries for different themes. Icon libraries need to be provided as SVG images and will be converted to bitmap formats.
It does NOT make use of async features of node.js for now. The aim is to port old processing scripts to node.js. Basically it is used to convert an icon library to a different color skin with different states ('hover', 'static', ...)

Many thanks to the community for sharing modules and documentation! 

node.js creates the following output folder structure:

/tmp/outIcons$timestamp$/
/tmp/outIcons$timestamp$/liferay_icons
/tmp/outIcons$timestamp$/tmpSVG
/tmp/outIcons$timestamp$/uie_icons

convertIcon.js ... converts, copies to a folder called uie_icons
serveIcon.js ... creates a testIcon.html which shows all the files, that have been created (!!not working for now due to problems with jsdom/contextify!!)
watch.js ... watches the output folder for new files (!!still in preparation!!)

Planning:

- include icon library bundle
- serve dynamic/async
- put new files to pipe
