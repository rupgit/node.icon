node.icon 0.2 (Alpha)

author: rupgit

node.icon is a set of scripts that aim at converting SVG images to GIF format.
It does NOT make use of async features of node.js for now. The aim is to port old processing scripts to node.js.
Basically it is used to convert an iconset to a different color skin with different states ('hover', 'static', ...)

Many thanks to the community for sharing modules and documentation! 

To get it running create the folder structure:

/tmp/node.icon/images/sourceSVG

convertIcon.js ... converts, copies do a folder called uie_icons
serveIcon.js ... creates a testIcon.html which shows the files, that have been created
watch.js ... watches the output folder for new files

Planning:

- include icon library bundle
- serve dynamic/async
- put new files to pipe
